# Java-Project-1
This project is written in java and uses the awt library
here is a discription of the project:
Using the program's startup argument, supply a limited number of words, made only of Latin characters. Show each character (including separators) as an object of a class that will store in its fields:
- information about the character
- a binary value representing that character.
Store all the objects created that way within a collection appropriate to the parameters of the set.

Based on this collection, visualize a parachute canopy on the screen. The sequence of the canopy colors shall reflect the message provided as the startup argument. As an example, take the attached picture of the Perseverance rover's parachute.
